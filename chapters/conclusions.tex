I proposed a general method for image fusion using MST and sparse representation.It gave us the result which overcome the disadvantage introduced in MST and SR method individually. Training time for Dictionary is relatively high.We use a dataset consisting different type of image and which contains about 40 images.For thresolding the image we use bayesShrik thresholding which take the threshold value in different direction of image under certain transformation domain, 
giving a good threshold result there for the image is noiseless in great measure. In the future, this model can be enhanced and cope
with different efficient transformation domain which can take the geometry of  image in better way. So it will be interesting to see how advancement is made in this approach.
