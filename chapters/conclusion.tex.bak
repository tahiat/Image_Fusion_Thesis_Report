We have presented an easy and simple approach to classify multi-label images using a trained single-label image classifier with objectness measure and selective search of an image. It gave us the result in quick time. Our training time for single-label network is fast. Segmenting the images is also fast. Our technique is a stepping stone to this approach. It is giving a good threshold result. In the future, this model can be enhanced and cope with larger dataset. So it will be interesting to see how advancement is made in this approach.
