We have presented an easy and simple approach to tag multi-label images using a trained CNN classifier with objectness measure and selective search of an image. It gave us the result in quick time. Our training time for CNN network is fast. Segmenting the images is also fast. Our technique is a stepping stone to this approach. It is giving a good threshold result. In the future, this model can be enhanced and cope with larger dataset. So it will be interesting to see how advancement is made in this approach.
