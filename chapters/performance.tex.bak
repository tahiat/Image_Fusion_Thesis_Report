\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Experimental Result for CIFAR-10}

In the fig \ref{cifar10conf} there is the result for the testing images of CIFAR-10 dataset. Here each row represents the testing label, each column represents the label produced by the network. For example the cell (1,1) represents that the testing label is airplane and the classified label is airplane, the cell (1,2) represents that the testing label is airplane and the classified label is automobile. So, each cell (i,i) where $[i = 1..10]$ represents the correctly classified labels. Each row consists of 10000 image labels. So the accuracy will be cell$(i,i)/1000$.

\subsection{Experimental Result for Multi-Label Image Classification}
To give an overview of the process of inspecting the result of the segmented images, we will need the help of Table from Figure \ref{score}. The table is for a single multi-label image. Each $image_{i}$ represents the segmented image from the multi-label image. Each row represents the class scores given by the network. 

\paragraph{Selecting Top 1 score:}
In this approach we select the top 1 score and its associating label from each segmented image $image_{i}$. Then we increase the frequency of labels for each top 1 score. After that we select the top 4 scoring labels. For example, in the Figure \ref{score} the top 1 label for $image_{1}$ would be cat. So we increase the frequency of cat by 1. Similarly for $image_{2}$ again the score for label cat is highest. So frequency of cat will be increased by 1.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Selecting Top 2 score:}
In this approach we select the top 2 scores and its associating label from each segmented image $image_{i}$. Then we increase the frequency of labels for each top 2 scores. After that we select the top 4 scoring labels.  For example, in the Figure \ref{score} the top 2 labels for $image_{1}$ would be cat and deer. So the frequency of cat and deer will be increased by 1.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Selecting Total score:}
In this approach we just add all scores of each $label_{i}$ for each segmented image $image_{i}$. Then we select the top 4 scoring labels. For example, every class score for every label will be added. So, the score for cat label will be the total score in the column cat. Similarly the score for bird will be the total score in the column bird.

\end{figure}



\paragraph{Selecting cumulative percentage:}
Each $label_{i}$ of segmented image $image_{i}$ has the percentage $score_{i} / \sum_{i}{score_{i}}$. We select the top percentage from each segmented image $image_{i}$. We add these percentages for each associated labels and select the top 4 scoring labels. For example for $image_{1}$ the percentage of cat will be $score_{cat} / \sum_{i}{score_{i}}$.\hfill \break

The results for these four approaches for the sample image from Figure \ref{sample_multi_label} is given at Figure \ref{resobj} and Figure \ref{ressel} \hfill \break


These approaches were repeated in our selected multi label images. The results for Objectness Measure is given in Figure \ref{finobj} and for Selective Search in Figure  \ref{finsel}
